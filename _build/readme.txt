The Markdown Editor for Umbraco is a data-type that allows you to write your content using Markdown syntax.
Configuration options are available to enable/disable the WMD Editor (powered by MarkEdit).

For a reference guide to the Markdown syntax, please visit: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax

The Markdown syntax is rendered by the MarkdownSharp processor library: http://code.google.com/p/markdownsharp/

Also available to download on the project page is a helper class that provides XSLT extensions to convert Markdown to HTML and vice-versa.
