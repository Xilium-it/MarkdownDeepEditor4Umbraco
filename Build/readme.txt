The "MarkdownDeep Editor for Umbraco" is a data-type that allows you to write your content using MarkdownDeep syntax.
Configuration options are available to enable/disable the WMD Editor (powered by MarkEdit).

This package is a fork of "Markdown Editor for Umbraco" developed by "leekelleher" (visit http://markdown4umb.codeplex.com/).

"MarkdownDeep Editor for Umbraco" uses MarkdownDeep instead of MarkdownSharp, that adds table feature with alignment, colspan and head-style sttributes to any table cell.
